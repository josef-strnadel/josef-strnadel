- 👋 Hi, I’m **Josef Strnadel**; actually, I work as an assistant professor at the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vut.cz)
- 👀 I’m **interested in** (but not limited to):
  - embedded, critical & cyber-physical systems (especially, based on CPUs such as ARM, ESPx, MSPx, STMx, HC(S)08, ...)
  - modeling & analysis of systems; (statistical) model checking using UPPAAL, ...
  - real-time (operating) systems; baremetal and/or based on FreeRTOS, uC/OS-II(I), Mbed, ...
  - dependability, testing and profiling of systems and their applications (at various abstraction levels)
  - objects, scenes, animations in Blender (formerly in Imagine, LightWave and Cinema 4D on Amiga)
  - unconventional topics such as digital steganography & steganalysis, autonomous/approximate systems, physically unclonable function, ...
- 🌱 I’m **currently learning** how to ...
  - reflect uncertainty during various kinds of the analysis, e,g, timing/schedulability analysis, of (mostly real-time) systems
  - automate the process of testing applications based on web, GUI etc., of generating a documentation from a source code, ...
  - allow a remote, multi-user management/access of/to UPPAAL, e.g., via a web/API
  - use scripting in Blender
- 💞️ I’m **looking to collaborate on**
  - projects & publishing results
  - leading student internships, theses & projects
  - design, modeling, analysis & implementation of systems

- 📫 **You can reach me**, e.g., via my [private email](mailto:josef.strnadel@gmail.com) or my [work contact](https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/strnadel/)
