- 👋 Hi, I’m **Josef Strnadel**; actually, I work as an assistant professor at the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vut.cz)
- 👀 I’m **interested in** (but not limited to):
  - embedded, critical & cyber-physical systems
  - microcontrollers; e.g., those based on ARM, ESP32, ...
  - real-time (operating) systems; e.g., FreeRTOS, uC/OS-II(I), MQX, ...
  - dependability & testing of systems and their applications
  - uncertainty, its causes & effects to the behavior of systems
  - modeling & analysis of dynamic systems and formal verification & model checking, statistical model checking in UPPAAL, ...
  - application of timed automata and modal logic
  - objects, scenes, animations in Blender (formerly in Imagine, LightWave and Cinema 4D on Amiga)
  - unconventional topics such as digital steganography & steganalysis, autonomous/approximate systems, physically unclonable function
- 🌱 I’m **currently learning** how to automate the process of testing applications based on web, GUI, ... and the process of generating a documentation from a source code
- 💞️ I’m **looking to collaborate on** projects & publishing results, on leading student internships, theses & projects and on the design, modeling, analysis & implementation of systems
