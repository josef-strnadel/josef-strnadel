- 👋 Hi, I’m **Josef Strnadel**; actually, I work as an assistant professor at the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vut.cz)
- 👀 I’m **interested in** (but not limited to):
  - dependability & testing
  - embedded, critical & cyber-physical systems
  - microcontrollers
  - real-time (operating) systems
  - uncertainty
  - modeling & analysis of dynamic systems
  - formal verification & model checking, statistical model checking
  - application of timed automata
  - steganography & steganalysis
  - unconventional topics such as approximate systems or physically unclonable function 
- 🌱 I’m **currently learning** how to automate the process of testing applications based on web, GUI etc.
- 💞️ I’m **looking to collaborate on** projects & publishing results, on leading student internships, theses & projects and on the design, modeling, analysis & implementation of systems
